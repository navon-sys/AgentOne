# Voice Implementation - Why You Can't Hear AI Voice

## üéØ Current Issue

**You're seeing**: Demo mode with text input  
**You're expecting**: AI voice asking questions + your voice being transcribed

## üîç Root Cause

### 1. AI Voice (Text-to-Speech) - NOT STREAMING
**Location**: `server/index.js` line 98-141

**Current Implementation**:
```javascript
// Backend generates MP3 audio
const mp3 = await openai.audio.speech.create({...})
const buffer = Buffer.from(await mp3.arrayBuffer())

// ‚ùå BUT: It just returns success, doesn't stream to LiveKit
res.json({ success: true, message: 'Question spoken' })
```

**What's Missing**:
- Audio is generated but not streamed to LiveKit room
- Needs to publish audio track to LiveKit
- Candidate never hears the AI voice

### 2. Voice Recognition (Speech-to-Text) - NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Location**: `src/components/InterviewRoom.jsx` line 284-292

**Current Implementation**:
```javascript
const startListening = async (questionIndex) => {
  // Listen for candidate's response
  // In a real implementation, this would use Deepgram
  // ‚ùå Nothing happens here!
}
```

**What's Missing**:
- No microphone audio capture for transcription
- No connection to Deepgram API
- No real-time transcription

## üìã What Needs to Be Implemented

### Option 1: Full LiveKit + AI Voice Flow (Complex)
**Pros**: Professional, real-time, scalable  
**Cons**: Complex LiveKit agent setup needed

**Components**:
1. LiveKit server-side agent
2. TTS streaming to room
3. STT from candidate's microphone
4. Real-time audio processing

### Option 2: Simple Client-Side Implementation (Easier)
**Pros**: Quick to implement, works immediately  
**Cons**: Less professional, browser-dependent

**Components**:
1. Browser Web Speech API for STT
2. Audio element for playing AI voice
3. Simple JavaScript, no LiveKit streaming needed

## üöÄ Recommended Implementation: Hybrid Approach

Use **browser APIs for MVP**, prepare for **LiveKit upgrade later**.

### Step 1: AI Voice (TTS)
**Backend sends audio URL**, frontend plays it

### Step 2: Voice Recognition (STT)  
**Use Web Speech API** (built into Chrome/Firefox)

### Step 3: Later Enhancement
**Migrate to LiveKit agents** for production

Would you like me to implement the **Quick Solution** using browser APIs? This will:
- ‚úÖ Let you hear AI questions
- ‚úÖ Transcribe your voice responses
- ‚úÖ Work in Chrome/Firefox/Edge immediately
- ‚úÖ Can upgrade to LiveKit later

Or would you prefer the **Full LiveKit Solution** which is more complex but professional?
