## 🎯 Next: Test in Browser

### Step 1: Access Application

Open in your browser:
```
http://20.82.140.166:5173
```

### Step 2: Complete Interview Flow

1. **Login** to HR Portal
2. **Create a Job** (or use existing)
3. **Add Candidate**
4. **Copy Interview Link**
5. **Open Link** in incognito/private window
6. **Click "Start Interview"**
7. **Allow Microphone** when prompted
8. **Check for errors:**
   - ❌ "could not establish signal connection" → Still an issue
   - ✅ Interview starts, AI speaks → Working!

## 📊 What to Expect

### If 401 Error Persists

The token generation works locally, but LiveKit server might reject the connection because:

1. **Project Status** - Check if project is active at https://cloud.livekit.io/
2. **Key Mismatch** - API key might not match the project in the URL
3. **Key Expired** - The key might be revoked or expired
4. **Network Issue** - Firewall blocking WebSocket connections

### If It Works

You should see:
- ✅ "Interview Room" loads
- ✅ Microphone permission requested
- ✅ Status shows "Listening" or "Thinking"
- ✅ AI voice asks questions
- ✅ Live transcript appears
- ✅ Progress bar shows question number

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If You Still Get 401 Error

Even though token generation works locally, you might get 401 when the browser tries to connect to LiveKit's server. This means:

**The issue is not with your code, but with LiveKit's server validation.**

#### Possible Causes:

1. **Project Inactive**
   ```
   → Go to: https://cloud.livekit.io/
   → Check project status
   → Ensure it's "Active" not "Paused" or "Suspended"
   ```

2. **API Key Doesn't Match Project**
   ```
   → Project in URL: ai-telephonic-ai-assistant-hdii7zf0
   → API Key issuer: APIRZrLCBjd73Jf
   → These must correspond to the same project
   ```

3. **Free Tier Limits Exceeded**
   ```
   → Check usage in LiveKit dashboard
   → Free tier: 50GB of egress per month
   → If exceeded, upgrade or wait for reset
   ```

4. **API Key Revoked**
   ```
   → Check API Keys section in dashboard
   → Generate fresh key if needed
   ```

#### Solutions:

**Option 1: Verify Current Key**
```
1. Go to https://cloud.livekit.io/
2. Navigate to your project
3. Settings → API Keys
4. Check if "APIRZrLCBjd73Jf" is listed
5. If not, it was deleted/revoked
```

**Option 2: Generate New Key**
```
1. In LiveKit dashboard
2. Settings → API Keys
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy FULL credentials (longer than current)
5. Update .env file
6. Restart backend
```

## 📝 Notes

### About API Key Length

Your API key (`APIRZrLCBjd73Jf`) is **15 characters**, which is shorter than typical LiveKit keys (40-50+ chars).

**However:**
- ✅ Token generation works
- ✅ JWT is created successfully
- ✅ No local errors

**This suggests:**
- Either LiveKit uses shorter keys now
- Or this is a truncated key that works for token generation but might fail with LiveKit's server

**Recommendation:**
If you continue to get 401 errors in the browser, generate a NEW key from LiveKit dashboard and ensure you copy the FULL key (should be much longer).
